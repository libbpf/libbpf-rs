This crate adheres to Cargo's [semantic versioning rules][cargo-semver]. At a
minimum, it builds with the most recent Rust stable release minus five minor
versions ("N - 5"). E.g., assuming the most recent Rust stable is `1.68`, the
crate is guaranteed to build with `1.63` and higher.

Please note that the generated skeleton files, while guaranteed to be source
code compatible according to aforementioned versioning rules, are not guaranteed
to be character identical between releases (including patch releases).
